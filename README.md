## Exercises in statistical model fitting for grad students

### Overview

These assignments are meant for new graduate students in [my
lab](http://chandlerlab.uga.edu/). They assume that students have some
basic familiarity with statistical inference, but most students will
need help getting through the first few exercises before they are
comfortable with the process of writing likelihood equations and joint
posterior distributions.


### Viewing the exercises and keys

The recommended way to view the exercises and keys is through the [companion
website](https://rbchan.github.io/stats/). However, you can also build
the files yourself by running 'knitr' on source code in this
repository. Most keys will not be publically available. 


### Disclaimer

There are bound to be mistakes in the exercises. Please let me know if you find any and I will try to correct them.
